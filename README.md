The Java application for a Snow Equipment Hire shop offers a comprehensive command-line interface, enabling users to rent equipment, list available gear, view customer information, and review rental agreements. The program employs classes for Equipment, Customer, and RentalAgreement to manage data efficiently. Customers can rent equipment by specifying their ID, equipment ID, and rental duration. The system displays detailed information, including equipment names, daily rates, customer names, and contact details. Although this simplified program uses in-memory data storage, a real-world implementation would typically employ a database for persistent data storage and retrieval.
